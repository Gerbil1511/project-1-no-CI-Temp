  <p class="my-4">Welcome to our website, dedicated to promoting diversity and inclusion for primary school age
    children. Teaching these concepts is crucial for a child's educational and personal development, as it
    fosters a more compassionate, empathetic, and inclusive society. In today's diverse world, it is essential
    to equip children with the skills to appreciate and respect differences in culture, race, gender, ability,
    and more.
    By introducing these concepts at a young age through stories, games, and everyday interactions, you can help
    children understand that everyone has something special to offer. Our site provides a wealth of resources,
    including book recommendations, videos and printable posters, all designed to make
    teaching diversity and inclusion fun and engaging. We aim to support parents and teachers in creating an
    inclusive environment where children can grow, learn, and thrive, raising a generation committed to making
    the world a more inclusive and harmonious place.</p>

              <p class="card-text"><strong>Diversity</strong> is when there are many different kinds of people, things,
                or ideas all
                together. Imagine you have a big box of crayons with lots of different colors like red, blue, green, and
                yellow. Each color is
                unique and special in its own way, and when you use all of them together, you can create a beautiful and
                interesting picture.In the same way, people are different too.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some have different skin colors, some speak different languages and some have different customs or
                traditions. This diversity makes the world a more interesting and
                fun place to live in, just like how all the different crayon colors make your picture special. So,
                diversity is all about celebrating and appreciating all the unique things that make each person special.

              <p class="card-text"><strong>Inclusion</strong> is when everyone feels welcome and included, no matter how
                different they
                are. Imagine you're playing a game with your friends, and you make sure that every single person gets
                to join in and have fun. You don't leave anyone out, and you make sure everyone feels happy and part of
                the group.<br>
                <br>
                In the same way, inclusion means making sure that everyone, no matter what they look like, where they
                come from, or what they can do, feels like they belong. It's about being kind, respectful, and making
                sure everyone has an equal chance to participate and enjoy things together. So, inclusion is all about
                creating a friendly and fair environment where everyone feels valued and included.
